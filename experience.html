        <h2>Kilang Kopi</h2>
        <p>I began working at a coffee factory as soon as I completed my SPM, eager to gain practical experience and support myself. I was assigned to the production area, helping with roasting and weighing coffee beans in the factory’s warm, aromatic environment. Although the job lasted only a few weeks, I learned valuable lessons about discipline, teamwork, and staying efficient under pressure. Even in that short time, the experience taught me the importance of patience and responsibility in a factory setting.</p>

        <h2>Edlee Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>I spent three months working at Edlee Fried Chicken in Kota Bharu right after finishing my SPM, diving into the fast-paced world of food service. Stationed at the counter and behind the fryer, I helped prepare crispy, affordable fried chicken often drawing comments from customers who said Edlee tastes even better than KFC. 
		The busy weekends taught me to stay calm under pressure, maintain speed during rush hours, and work smoothly with teammates. Though it was a short chapter, the job sharpened my confidence, discipline, and appreciation for friendly, efficient hospitality skills that I carried with me into university.</p>

        <h2>UiTM Kelantan Futsal</h2>
        <p>I spent two and a half years as the goalkeeper for UiTM Kelantan’s futsal squad, standing ready between the posts in every training and match, even though we never managed to snag a win. The role pushed me to sharpen fast reflexes, master footwork for close-range saves, and command my defense with clear, confident communication. 
		    Futsal’s high-paced nature meant I was never far from the action: I dove low, palmed away powerful shots, and frequently used my feet to play the ball out techniques crucial in matches and learned through countless drills 
		    . Though victories eluded us, the teamwork, resilience, and composure I built on the court shaped me lessons I carry with me as I move into the next chapter of my journey.</p>

        <h2>JPK Kolej TR</h2>
        <p>I organised the buka puasa event at Kolej TR as part of JPK, planning the menu, coordinating volunteers, and preparing over 300 meal packs. Seeing everyone gather for food and prayer in a warm Ramadan atmosphere was deeply rewarding.</p>

        <p>I was the goalkeeper for the non-resident team at CGames (Colleges Games), representing our college in the futsal tournament. Though we only made it to the quarter-finals, the experience sharpened my reflexes, boosted my communication with defenders, and strengthened my resolve under pressure.</p>
