      <p>Every day at SKGongDermin, I arrive eager to serve as a library prefect, assisting classmates with borrowing and returning books, organizing shelves, and handling digital library checkouts via our flip‑book system 
	  . I guide students through virtual reading platforms, ensuring they easily access e‑books and reference materials. During breaks, I monitor the space, help peers locate resources, and maintain a friendly, orderly atmosphere. It feels rewarding when teachers and students thank me, it shows that my small efforts help make the resource centre a welcoming hub for learning and curiosity.</p>

      <p>My first secondary school was Maahad Ar-Rahmah Kenali, located in Kubang Kerian right next to the Kelantan state palace. I actually entered the school because my father insisted, but it turned out to be a great experience. The environment was fun, and I made many good friends there. One unique thing was that we were required to pray the Zuhur prayer in congregation before going home. I learned so much during my time there, especially about religion. Even though I only studied there from Form 1 to Form 4 before transferring after the COVID-19 pandemic, the memories and lessons will always stay with me..</p>

      <p>My second secondary school was Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Puteri Saadong. I transferred there due to certain personal reasons, around mid-year after the COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted. Everyone there welcomed me warmly, they were really friendly, especially as we got closer to SPM. I stayed in the hostel, and so many things happened during that time. It was truly a beautiful and unforgettable experience. I also made new friends and connections there, which made my time even more meaningful.</p>

      <p>I’m currently studying at <a href="https://uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/"><i style="color:maroon;">UiTM</i></a> Machang, where I’m taking a Diploma in Information Management. This year marks both my final year and final semester here. After spending three years at this campus, I’ve created so many memories, all of them meaningful. What made it even more special was getting to know people from different backgrounds, especially those from outside Kelantan. In my last semester, which was Semester 4, I managed to achieve a CGPA of 3.33, and I’m proud of how far I’ve  come.</p>
